<h1><strong><em>Tessellator</em></strong></h1>
Tessellator is KMIT’s learning management system.</br>
 It is customized version of Moodle, an open source learning management system provided by Google.</br>
 We at KMIT have customized it as per our needs and have been using it on multiple networks.</br>
 It provides an option of 2 different modules.</br>
 After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple choice questions.</br>
 Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held.</br>
 There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test.</br>
 If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program.</br>
 The fast learners may go to the 3rd program.</br>
 Google’s platform Moodle by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other programming languages.</br>
